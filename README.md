**falcon-mcp** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI agents with the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, powering intelligent security analysis in your agentic workflows. It delivers programmatic access to essential security capabilities—including detections, threat intelligence, and host management—establishing the foundation for advanced security operations and automation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🚧 Public Preview**: This project is currently in public preview and under active development. Features and functionality may change before the stable 1.0 release. While we encourage exploration and testing, please avoid production deployments. We welcome your feedback through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/crowdstrike/falcon-mcp/issues) to help shape the final release.

## Quick Start

### Install

#### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install falcon-mcp
```

#### Using pip

```bash
pip install falcon-mcp
```

### Configure

Set the required environment variables (or use a `.env` file — see the [Configuration Guide](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/getting-started/configuration/)):

```bash
export FALCON_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export FALCON_BASE_URL="https://api.crowdstrike.com"
```

### Run

```bash
falcon-mcp
```

See the [Getting Started guide](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/getting-started/installation/) for full installation and configuration details.

## Editor Integration

### Using `uvx` (recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--env-file",
        "/path/to/.env",
        "falcon-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### With Module Selection

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--env-file",
        "/path/to/.env",
        "falcon-mcp",
        "--modules",
        "detections,hosts,intel"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--env-file",
        "/full/path/to/.env",
        "quay.io/crowdstrike/falcon-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

See the [Usage guide](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/usage/cli/) for all command line options, module configuration, and library usage.

## Container Usage

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull quay.io/crowdstrike/falcon-mcp:latest

# Run with .env file (stdio transport)
docker run -i --rm --env-file /path/to/.env quay.io/crowdstrike/falcon-mcp:latest

# Run with streamable-http transport (add --api-key when the port is reachable beyond localhost)
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file /path/to/.env \
  quay.io/crowdstrike/falcon-mcp:latest \
  --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key your-secret-key
```

> [!CAUTION]
> HTTP transports have no authentication by default. Binding to a non-loopback address (`--host 0.0.0.0`)
> exposes an unauthenticated server that anyone who can reach the port can drive with your CrowdStrike
> credentials. Keep the default loopback bind for local use and set `--api-key` whenever you bind wider.
> Managed runtimes such as AWS Bedrock AgentCore and Google Cloud Run sit behind their own network
> security layer, so this does not apply to them. See the
> [Configuration guide](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/getting-started/configuration/#http-transport-security).

See the [Docker Deployment guide](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/deployment/docker/) for building locally, custom ports, and advanced configurations.

## Dynamic Mode

Running many modules at once inflates the context window every AI client must hold. Dynamic mode
replaces the full tool surface with three tools — `falcon_list_enabled_modules` to see which
modules are loaded, `falcon_search_tools` to discover the right tool on demand, and
`falcon_execute_tool` to run it — so agents only load the schemas they actually need.

```bash
falcon-mcp --dynamic
# or: FALCON_MCP_DYNAMIC=true
```

See the [Dynamic Mode guide](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/usage/dynamic-mode/) for
the full discover → execute workflow and trade-offs.

## Deployment Options

- [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/falcon-mcp/deployment/amazon-bedrock/)
- [Google Cloud (Cloud Run / Vertex AI)](./examples/adk/README.md)
